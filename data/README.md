Dev Data
========

`introspect.xsd` is the schema used to validate specs.

Real-World Testing
------------------
`real/` contains some real specs obtained from apps.
These have been modified to fit better with the generator,
but the modifications were simple (remove the dtd header and
clean up interfaces).

These are _not_ licensed under the GPL and are instead licensed
under their original librariesâ€™ licence.

Comprehensive Testing
---------------------
`test/` contains some specs used for comprehensive testing.
