DBus Binding Generator Ada
==========================
Generates high-level, convenient Ada bindings given a DBus XML specification.

Compile and run `./dbus_binding_generator_ada` to see tool usage.

Test XML specifications can be found in `data/`, test code can be found in `test/`

Client Binding Usage
--------------------
```ada
with Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
with Interfaces;

with org_freedesktop_portal_FileChooser;
with org_freedesktop_portal_Print;

with D_Bus.Support;

procedure Main is
    type OFP_Subset is new D_Bus.Support.Root_Object
        and org_freedesktop_portal_FileChooser
        and org_freedesktop_portal_Print;

    OFP_Desktop : OFP_Subset;
begin
    OFP_Desktop.Create (Ada.Strings.Unbounded.To_Unbounded_String ("/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop"));
    --  Assign a D_Bus path to this Ada proxy object

    OFP_Desktop.Set_Destination ("org.freedesktop.portal.Destkop");
    --  Assign a destination so libdbus knows where to send messages

    --  Now call any and all methods on /org/freedesktop/portal/desktop as if they were Ada subprograms.
    declare
        Value : Interfaces.Unsigned_32;
    begin
        OFP_Desktop.MethodName (parameter => Value);

        --  OFP_Subset is a subset of all the interfaces that
        --  OFP_Desktop implements. You probably wouldnâ€™t actually
        --  need to access every interface at once, but even if you did
        --  it would still be possible (and easy) using these bindings!
        OFP_Desktop.OpenFile (<>);
        OFP_Desktop.Print (<>);
    end;

    --  Signals work as follows:
    OFP_Desktop.Register_SignalName;
    --  Start listening for this signal
    declare
        Result : Ada.Strings.Unbounded.Unbounded_String;
    begin
        OFP_Desktop.Await_SignalName (Result);
        --  Block until the signal is emitted
    end;
    OFP_Desktop.Unregister_SignalName;
    --  Stop listening for this signal

    --  Properties are easy too:
    Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Ada.Strings.Unbounded.To_String (OFP_Desktop.PropertyName));
    OFP_Desktop.Set_PropertyName (Ada.Strings.Unbounded.To_Unbounded_String ("Test Value"));
    --  * note that properties only work if the interface `org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties` is
    --  implemented by the object in question.

    OFP_Desktop.Destroy;
    --  Clean up everything
end Main;
```
